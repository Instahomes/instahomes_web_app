                     <p class="body-dark mb-4">Looking for the perfect property may seem daunting because of all the factors to consider. You need to keep up with the current market trends, be familiar with the terms, and take into consideration your personal preferences. In this article, we're easing the burden by presenting the indicators that you need to get started on your search for the perfect property. 
                    <h2 class="header-dark mb-4">Location Indicators</h2>
                    <p class="body-dark mb-4">The three words of advice that you hear the most in real estate are "Location, Location, Location." Buying a good property involves looking for the best location that would suit your preferences and purpose. This also ensures getting the most value for your investment.
                        <br><br>The place where a property is situated in tells a lot about the lifestyle that the surrounding communities have. If you're looking to buy a home for you and your family to relax, wind down, or be away from the bustling noise of the city, then it would probably be a good choice to look at provincial properties. 
                     <br></p>
                        <img src="assets/blog-image-2.jpg" class="blog-image"></img>
                        <p class="body-dark" style="margin-top: -20px; font-size: 0.8em; color:#688AB5"> Watch out for Bel-air Residences, one of our first partner developers, in our upcoming website launch.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p class="body-dark mb-4">Preferences may differ per person. Once you settle on your purpose for investment, here are three important aspects that should help you find the right location for your new home.
                        <h4 class="header-dark mb-4">1. Accessibility</h4>
                        <p class="body-dark mb-4">We all know that we shouldn't just buy a property in the middle of nowhere, but how do we know which locations are valuable? We can start with its accessibility. Can you get there easily through different means of transportation (e.g. by car or by commute)? Are there any nearby facilities that you can quickly go to when needed (e.g. hospitals, convenience stores, malls, etc.)? How long will it take to get to your day-to-day activities (e.g. work, school)? 
                        <h4 class="header-dark mb-4">2. Safety</h4>
                        <p class="body-dark mb-4">With accessibility also comes the importance of safety. In buying a good home, you have to safeguard yourself and your entire family. Some questions that you could think about in terms of the location's security could be: Am I comfortable to walk around the area alone? Would I let my children go out to play in front of the house? When looking at villages, you can also check how the guards in that particular subdivision treat you as a visitor. 
                        <h4 class="header-dark mb-4">3. Amenities</h4>
                        <p class="body-dark mb-4">Finally, it is also viable to think about the amenities that you would frequent, depending on your lifestyle. How near are you to business centers like malls and restaurants, parks, areas of worship, and other places of interest?
                    <br></p>

                    <h2 class="header-dark mb-4">Market Trends</h2>
                    <p class="body-dark mb-4">Once you decide on your location or area, a good indicator of a valuable property and investment comes from the market trends of that place. It's good to be able to compare these rates with other areas that you may also be interested in, as well as with popular markets in order to have a benchmark. Here are two important trends to monitor: 
                        <h4 class="header-dark mb-4">1. Vacancy Rate</h4>
                        <p class="body-dark mb-4">This lets you know about the demand for rental properties in the area. A higher vacancy rate shows lower demand for properties, meaning not a lot of people are investing in this market. Therefore, there are more properties that are cheaper to own. On the other hand, a lower vacancy rate shows that the area has more competitive properties. You may want to look into the possible reasons for such, but all in all, this measurement can also show you the difference in prices within the markets.
                        <h4 class="header-dark mb-4">2. Days on Market (DOM)</h4>
                        <p class="body-dark mb-4">In relation to the vacancy rate, checking out the average DOM trend would also be a good indicator of activity in the area. If the trend is going upward, then that means the properties have been available for a longer time, and there would be a higher opportunity to close a deal. 

                        <h2 class="header-dark mb-4">Supply and Demand</h2>
                    <p class="body-dark mb-4">As with any other investment, a crucial aspect to consider in terms of finding the right place and the right property would boil down to its economic indicators — or supply and demand. Whether its in a Central Business District (CBD) or in a more laid-back location, economic activity and opportunities available around the property will show great support for your investment.

                    <h2 class="header-dark mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p class="body-dark mb-4">As with making a big decision like buying a valuable property, there are too many factors to compare. Although, there is great value in finding the balance between these indicators and your personal preferences. Most importantly, you want to be able to find a place that you can trust. Which is why Instahomes positions itself and partners only with trusted developers to protect you from risky decisions and online scams.
