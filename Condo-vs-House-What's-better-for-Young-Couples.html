                    <p class="body-dark mb-4">If you just got married or are about to start a family of your own, chances are you are part of the millennial group. Aside from coining the term 'adulting', your generation has time and again been more openly receptive to new ways of living. When it was conventional to look for a house and lot after the nuptials, millennials were open to more economical use of spaces like condos.
                        <br><br>Of course, making that decision between house and condo takes quite a lot of research, budgeting, and planning. Both are extremely unique in their own way and investing in either one is a commitment that would actively shape the first few years of a new chapter in your life. 
                        <br><br>To make this adulting dilemma easier, Instahomes has compiled a couple of important considerations for picking out your first home. </p>
                        <br> 
                        <h2 class="header-dark mb-4">Condos offer a more affordable entry point, but Houses and lot give better value in space</h2>
                    <p class="body-dark mb-4"><h5>Starting List Price</h5>
                        <p class="body-dark mb-4">Starting from one of the most obvious factors in investing, condos tend be more affordable than buying a landed house of the same tier. A house in Metro Manila is expected to cost more than double the price of a condo in the same area based on the median list price in key property portals being about Php 6 million in condos versus that of close to Php 15 million in houses. For low and mid-range condos, price can go as low as Php 1 million. The accessibility coupled with great features that developments offer makes condos an attractive option up for grabs for young couples.
                    </p>
                            <img src="assets/instahomes-WVTowerII.webp" class="blog-image"></img>
                            <p class="body-dark" style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-top:-10px; color:#708298">This 1 Bedroom with Loft in WV Tower II, one of the condo units by B&P Property Group, found in the heart of Iloilo is something to look out for as it launches in Instahomes</p>
                            <p class="body-dark mb-4"><h5>Price per sqm</h5>
                            <p class="body-dark mb-4">It is important to note though that while condos are more accessible in pricing, they also come in smaller packages. Often times, condos cost over two times more per square meter based on floor size. On average, you would be paying much more for additional space in condos than house and lot. While bigger spaces isn't really for all, it is good to take this into consideration when buying as it would still help you weigh a unit's value for money. Larger spaces in houses allow for higher appreciation rate especially if one invests in rising communities that will keep on growing the land's value.</p>
                            <img src="assets/instahomes-TagaytayForbes.webp" class="blog-image"></img>
                            <p class="body-dark" style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-top:-10px; color:#708298">Tagaytay is a booming community and Goldstar Realty's Tulip Model in Tagaytay Forbes Residences is a great home to invest in for that great breeze.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="header-dark mb-4">Condos provide a lifestyle of convenience while House and lot provide one of personalization</h2>
                    <p class="body-dark mb-4"><h5>Amenities, Maintenance and Security</h5>
                        <p class="body-dark mb-4"> One of the best features of condo units has to be their accessibility to great amenities like swimming pools, gyms, and function halls. As part of the development's services, these amenities are available to all condo dwellers for free or a minimum fee. Maintenance and security are also available 24/7, making life in the condo very convenient with all the services it provides. 
                        <br><br> While house and lot owners do enjoy some amenities too based on developments, it is often less accessible in distance to them. House and lot owners will have to outsource maintenance and set up additional security systems on top of gated communities, but this means it offers them a lot more options to personalize their homes. With a larger area and less strict policies imposed, the house and lot lifestyle provides a high level of customization that is really difficult to do with condos.

                            <img src="assets/instahomes-AmaiaSkiesAvenida.webp" class="blog-image"></img>
                            <p class="body-dark" style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-top:-10px; color:#708298">Amaia Skies Avenida boasts great amenities like the open pool complementing its light and tropical ambiance.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <h2 class="header-dark mb-4">Philippine Houses and Condos both show good points for investment </h2>
                    <p class="body-dark mb-4"><h5>Appreciation Potential</h5>
                        <p class="body-dark mb-4">There is much to be wary in seeking out properties that would appreciate well since buying a home is a financial investment in itself. Because houses also include the lot that it's on, often times the value of these appreciate better over time with over 160% annual growth rate in prime locations like Makati over the 40% average that condos can offer in the same area. Fairly speaking, these rates do vary across regions. In fact, in Davao landed house is said to go as low as 0.7% while condos go for a whopping 8.1%, which means that appreciation potential is indefinite and influenced by other factors.</p>
                        <p class="body-dark mb-4"><h5>Property Life & Location Value</h5>
                            <p class="body-dark mb-4"> Condos leverage on their great positioning in the city as a means of increasing their value and rental rates. More so, the convenience of a prime location especially if it's near job establishments makes it such a valuable asset to have for cost-savings and growth. That said, house-and-lots do provide one thing that condo's struggle with: long life expectancy. If you're looking for a long-term investment, houses outlive condos due to the lifespan that condos naturally have. Most condos designed today live to up to 50 years. Although it doesn't mean that you will lose the entirety of your investment since you will automatically be a shareholder of the corporation, it is still something you should take into consideration if you're looking at the long term.
